#Write a program that asks the user for a username and password.
#If either or both are incorrect, the program ask the user to enter the username and password again.
# This continues until the login information is correct or wrong credentials have been entered five times.
# If the information is correct, the program prints out Welcome. After five failed attempts the program prints out Access denied.
# The correct username is python and password rules.
